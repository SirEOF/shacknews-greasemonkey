shacknews-greasemonkey
======================

A collection of Greasemonkey scripts written to ... enhance(?) your Shacknews viewing pleasure

*NOTE: I have no illusions about this code.  It's a mess. Most of it was built up over the ages, with adjustments made as-needed because of the shifting sands of the very early Greasemonkey extension releases and no one (well, I really only have myself to blame) has gone through to add any kind of order to the chaos.*

# Essential Scripts

**Shack[LOL]** [[install](https://github.com/ThomW/shacknews-greasemonkey/raw/master/shack-lol.user.js)]  
Adds [lol], [inf] and a myriad of other colorful and amazing buttons to posts as well as links to the Shack[lol] page to the comments

**Collapse Button Fix** [[install](https://github.com/ThomW/shacknews-greasemonkey/raw/master/shack-collapse.user.js)]  
Fixes those useless collapse buttons so they actually stay collapsed when you refresh the page like they're supposed to. The Shack should really pay someone the $100 it would to fix that.  lolsrs

**Shacktags** [[install](https://github.com/ThomW/shacknews-greasemonkey/raw/master/shack-comment-tags.user.js)]  
Adds a Shacktag menu to the comment posting box. You can click a tag and enter text to include in that tag, or write your post then highlight portions of it and click on a tag to update it. This is a disturbingly useful script.

**Message This User** [[install](https://github.com/ThomW/shacknews-greasemonkey/raw/master/shack-msgthisuser.user.js)]  
Adds links to Shackmessage people to the comments next to post authors' names just like in the old days.

**User Popup** [[install](https://github.com/ThomW/shacknews-greasemonkey/raw/master/shacknews_user_popup.user.js)]  
Adds a dropdown menu to usernames on the site to make it easy to search their posts, or their contributions to the [lol] hall of shame.

# Goofy Scripts

**Gegtik's Dinosaur Comics** [[install](https://github.com/ThomW/shacknews-greasemonkey/raw/master/gegtiks_dinosaur_comics.user.js)]  
This script is awesome. It turns all of gegtik's posts into totally sweet [Dinosaur Comics](http://qwantz.com/).

**Sparkly Comics** [[install](https://github.com/ThomW/shacknews-greasemonkey/raw/master/sparkly_comics.user.js)]  
This works just like Gegtik's Dinosaur Comics, but uses that strip of pictures Sparkly posted of himself. The script looks at the text in the post and makes a half-assed attempt at making it show the appropriate image.
